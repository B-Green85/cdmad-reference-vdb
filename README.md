# CDMAD Reference Vector Database API

Canonical reference implementation.

This repository provides a minimal, open-source Vector Database API used to
store and retrieve CDMAD policies, playbooks, rules, and command protocols for
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by machine agents.

This project is intentionally narrow in scope.

## What This Is

- A constraint-aware Vector DB API
- A persistence layer for CDMAD knowledge artifacts
- A reference implementation others may study or build against

## What This Is Not

- An agent framework
- An auto-coder
- A workflow engine
- A UI, dashboard, or SaaS product

## Authority Model

CDMAD (Constraint-Driven Machine-Assisted Development) is the senior authority
governing this repository.

Machine agents may assist in implementation but have no authority to promote
changes without explicit human approval.

Evidence beats explanation.

## Reference vs Compatible Implementations

This repository is the canonical reference implementation.

Other projects may be compatible with CDMAD concepts without being considered
canonical.
