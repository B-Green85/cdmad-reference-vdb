# Origin

This repository exists to provide a canonical reference implementation for
CDMAD-aligned vector storage and retrieval.

It was created to solve a specific problem:

Machine agents require access to authoritative constraints, policies, and
playbooks, but must not be allowed to invent or silently mutate them.

This repository encodes that boundary.

It is intentionally minimal.
